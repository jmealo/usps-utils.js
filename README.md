â˜Ž Phoney 
=============================
Phoney extracts US phone numbers from HTML and arbitrary text.

What it's not for
-------
Unsolicited phone calls. Don't call people who you shouldn't call. Don't be that guy.

What it's for
-------
You can use it for anything *not* evil.

I created it to find if the businesses in my database had an official website so I could link to it.

By exluding a list of known directory sites for my particular industry and checking to make sure the website included the phone number (and not a large list of them) along with the business name and postal address I was able to find a business's website with a high level of accuracy.

If you need to extract phone numbers from unstructured data, highlight phone numbers or prevent the sharing of personal information, this code is efficient enough to run client or server-side and may fit your needs.
